                                                             PioneerTrail Game
PioneerTrail is an abridged version of the classic text-based adventure game OregonTrail. A settler travels with a friend, facing challenges and dangers along the way. This game teaches survival as you have to be smart in the choices you make along the trail as they could be benefiting or can damage your health and food supply. I made this game as a fun little summer project, I was able to implement a "Help mode" executed with the command (-Help) which displays rules and hints, this took a lot of research. But what I really enjoyed while making the game was the amount of digging in my brain it took to figure out ways to switch up the theme and format: points or no points? puzzles or narrative? or a combination of these.
